:gf:So, you had that nightmare again?
:bf-christmas-sad:Yeah...
:gf-mad:Hmm...
:bf-christmas-sad:I know it's just a dream and all, but...
:gf:Hey, it's okay, I get it.
:gf-love:Try not to let it get you down, okay?
:gf-love;No matter what some silly dream says, I'll always love you.
:bf-christmas:I'll always love you too, Girlfriend.
:mom:So, you DO speak english!
:bf-christmas-scared:BEEP!?
:gf-mad:Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
:gf-mad:Can't we have just one day out without someone taking him away for a rap battle?
:dad:Oh honey, we're not here for that. 
:mom:We just saw our little sweetie and couldn't help wanting to say hi!
:gf-mad:Geez, Mom! You're embarrassing me in front of Boyfriend!
:dad:Oh, don't tell me you're too grown up now to be around your folks!
:dad:(DD turns to BF)
:dad:But you... you'd better be treating my daughter right. 
:dad:The second I hear that you've made her cry...
:dad:(DD leans in close to BF's ear)
:dad:I'll cut your dick off.
:mom:Oh dear, don't scare the poor boy! If he breaks her heart, give him to me~
:gf-mad:Mom! Dad!
:mom:Oh, right.
:mom:we heard there was a karaoke place that'd opened up here, so we wanted to check it out.
:mom:We're willing to let you two go first if you want~
:dad:(we are?)
:mom:(c√°llate la boca, dearest.)
:gf-love:You are? Thanks!
:bf-christmas-sad:...
:gf-love:Come on, Boyfriend, it'll be fun!
